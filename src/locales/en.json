    "testRes2": "<li> <strong>Act</strong> <br/> Any activity, especially physical labor, acts as a lightning rod in a stressful situation; Stress is a very strong source of energy. You can discharge yourself in the simplest way: Put things in order at home or in the workplace; Arrange a walk or a brisk walk; Run; Beat a ball or a pillow, etc. </li> <li> <strong>Reframing</strong><br/> The word 'reframing' comes from the English word 'frame' (frame), so it can literally be translated as re-framing. Change of point of view, attitude to something, without changing the situation itself: Make it a rule to reframe at least three times: whenever something negative happens, try to find three positive consequences or gains that can be extracted from this trouble. </li> <li> <strong>Kinesiological complex of exercises</strong> <br/> One palm is placed on the back of the head, the other on the forehead. You can close your eyes and think about any negative situation relevant to you. Deep breath – exhale. Mentally imagine the situation again, but only in a positive aspect, to think about and realize how this problem could be solved. After the manifestation of a kind of 'pulsation' between the occipital and frontal parts, self–correction is completed by inhaling and exhaling. </li> <li> <strong>Discuss your situation with those who, having a similar experience, feel good</strong> <br/> Your condition can be relieved by physical and emotional support from other people. Do not expect that the severe conditions characteristic of burnout will go away on their own. If you do not take measures, they will visit you for a long time. Allocate sufficient time for sleep, rest, and reflection. Express your desires directly, clearly and honestly, talk about them to family, friends and at work. </li>",
    "testRes1": "<li> <strong>Self–confidence and adequate self-esteem are the basis for getting rid of social phobia.</strong> <br/> Work on self-confidence, study yourself, find your strengths and focus on them. Every person is terrible in some ways, and beautiful in some ways. To correct self-esteem and confidence, you can take trainings, download collections, for example, the work of Wayne Dyer 'How to believe in yourself'. The motto of this book is: 'When you believe, then you will see.' Or Philip Zimbardo 'Shyness', Robert Anthony 'The main secrets of absolute self-confidence'. It's individual. Please find the material and choose something suitable for yourself. </li> <li> <strong>Destroy the comfort zone</strong> <br/> No matter how it sounds, but the principle of 'wedge by wedge' often works with social phobia. You need to literally break yourself. A great start would be an interest club (perhaps you are creating something). Find what you are interested in (poetry, music) and share it with your colleagues. The second part of the breakdown is the conscious passage of frightening situations. </li> <li> <strong>Try to clearly formulate the cause of the phobia. </strong> <br/> If we are talking about a situation related to a specific person, then say it. Try to meet with this person and discuss everything. For example, if you understand that in childhood there was not enough support from your mother, but now you are in contact with her, then have the courage to express everything and ask exciting questions, to hear her position. If there is no such possibility (the person does not keep in touch), then write him a letter, state everything and burn the sheet. </li> <li> <strong>Feel belonging to the group</strong> <br/> It can be a yoga class or a clay modeling circle — everything that implies collectivity, meeting the same people at the same time and exchanging certain contacts. It is important that you feel part of the group. </li>",
    "testRes3": "<li> <strong>Psychological methods</strong> <br/> Choose one of the methods of relaxation of your mental state: auto-trainings, meditation, biofeedback method, self-regulation methods, music, prayer. Do it as needed, try not to burden your days and have fun with the little things. </li> <li> <strong>Physical training</strong> <br/> To improve sleep and rest, as you know, you need to train your body and muscles. Here are some Physiological methods that will help (impact on the body): sunlight, exercise, sunbathing, fresh air, walking, bathing, swimming, infrared radiation, Strelnikova breathing, breathing exercises. Choose one and try to maintain a normal routine of your life as much as possible. </li> <li> <strong>Digital detox and breathing</strong> <br/> Turn off all means of communication, computer, music, cinema for a few minutes. Engage in conscious breathing at this time. Five minutes of watching how you breathe will be enough for the body to recharge. It's only your five minutes, no one else's. </li>",
    "testRes4": "<li> <strong>Diversify your surroundings and surroundings</strong> <br/> Society has a great influence on us. Communication with people dissatisfied with life leads to a state of depression. Try to communicate with active, cheerful and happy people. To meet new interesting people, you can go to some kind of training, join an interest club. </li> <li> <strong>Balanced nutrition</strong> <br/> Monitor your daily diet, evaluate the mode and frequency. A varied and enriched diet will help improve well-being, add clarity of thinking and increase the amount of energy in the body. Consult with your doctor if the medications you are taking may cause weight gain. If so, special attention will need to be paid to nutrition. </li> <li> <strong>Do something new</strong> <br/> Try new things: hobbies, courses, studies and new experiences can improve mood and prevent negative thoughts and actions. Get out of the vicious circle, break the pattern of your life. Force yourself to do something, believe in yourself. </li>",
